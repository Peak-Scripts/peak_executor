# peak_executor

This is a simple FiveM in-game UI to run client-side code (also known as a Lua Executor). You can use it to test how secure your scripts are. Not recommended to use this in production.

To open it, press F7 (Admin permissions required).

If you have any ideas for improvements, feel free to let me know!
